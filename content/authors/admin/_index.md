I teach linguistics at Thammasat University in Thailand. I investigate issues related to probabilistic statistical information that bi/multilingual speakers recruit in second (L2) or additional language (Ln) processing and learning. Using a number of experimental methods, my research seeks to understand how such information guides online processing and shapes long-term representation of linguistic constructions in bi/multilinguals. I teach undergraduate courses in teaching methods and L2 acquisition.
