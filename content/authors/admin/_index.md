I am a lecturer of Linguistics in the Department of English and Linguistics at Thammasat University, Thailand. My research investigates the contribution of statistical regularities that underpin linguistic structures in adults' existing language(s) in second and additional language learning. At Thammasat, I teach courses in language teaching approaches, second language acquisition, and applied linguistics.
